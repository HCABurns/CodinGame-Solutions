# <b>Connections Visualiser</b>

The connections visualiser is a tool used during development to validate and debug. The program will create a 3D plot that will show connections between coordinates. The connections and coordinates are stored in the tests.py file and which are added after running Kruskal's algorithm on the set of coordinates.

# <b>Tests</b>

Tests holds all the connections and coordinates that will be plotted. Each function has it's own pair of coordinates and connections.

# 3D Coordinates Generator

Tool used to generate a set amount of 3D coordinates in user defined ranges.
