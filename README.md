# Introduction

CodingGame has a vast selection of challenging problems, in a variety of different contexts, requiring kno

There are multiple different modes available: Clash of Code, Puzzles, Code Golf, Bot Programming, Optimization. Each mode offers something unqiue and challenging.

## What is Clash of Code?

Clash of Code is a mode aimed at improving coding efficiency through racing other users to create a robust solution to a problem as quick as possible. There are three different modes available in Clash of Code: Fastest, Shortest and Reverse.

<b>Fastest:</b> This mode is to create a solution to a problem passing all validators as quick as possible.

<b>Shortest:</b> This mode is for creating a solution in the shortest number of charaters possible.

<b>Reverse:</b> This mode provides an input and output only. The user must decipher the problem only from this information and create a solution as quick as they can.

## What is Puzzles?

Puzzles are a selection of problems split into different difficulty levels. The goal is to provide a solution that will pass hidden validators to ensure a complete solution, including edge cases are handled correctly. Each problem is accompanied by tags releated to the problem, for example: Loops, BFS, Trie, Backtracking, Pathfinding, Cryptography, ... etc. 

## What is Code Golf?

Code golf is a challenge to achieve the shortest possible source code by using language specific tricks for a specific problem.

## What is Bot Programming?

Bot progamming is a challenge to create an AI to run thorugh a simulation in the best method for a given task. This could be as simple as a rules based approach to neural networks. A solution is tested against other users solutions and ranked based on how well it performs against others.

## What is Optimization?
